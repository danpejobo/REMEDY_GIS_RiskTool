# REMEDY_GIS_RiskTool
An open-source GIS-based tool based on the [GIBV method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0886779820306271) to quantify building damage risk due to deep excavation works from both wall deformation and drawdown-induced consolidation settlements. This tool is a result of the research project [REMEDY / Begrens Skade 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0886779820306271) (2017-2022) funded by several industry partners and the Norwegian Research Council (NFR). 

## Introduction
One of the main targets for the REMEDY project is to provide research and development that will enable the industry to perform more risk-informed planning, design and execution. Deep excavation and foundation work in soft clays may cause large settlements, resulting in damage to neighbouring buildings and structures. The costs related to these types of damage can be substantial. There is significant potential for reducing such costs if the causes are better understood and the risks are assessed during the project phases. 

**Functionality**
For all cornerpoints on building polygons within the zone of influence surrounding the footprint of a deep excavation, the following is calculated:
1. Analysis of vertical greenfield settlement due to retaining wall deformation, with distance from wall, based on experience database
2. Analysis of groundwater drawdown-induced consolidation settlements in clay, with distance from wall, based on experience database
